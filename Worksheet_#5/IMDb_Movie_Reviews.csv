NA,"FiRE010","Jul 3, 2021",10,"Really Great",NA,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it."
NA,"bruhperson","Mar 6, 2019",10,"It's ok I guess",NA,"Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it."
NA,"KinoKoopaKid","Jul 29, 2021",10,"99.1% pure",NA,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."

NA,"Supermanfan-13","Nov 8, 2021",10,"Damn near perfect!",NA,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"

It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!"

NA,"Shopaholic35","Feb 11, 2014",5,"Fantastic show that killed my spirit.",NA,"This is a hard show to review. The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking ""really, there are 5 seasons of this"". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.I know people will think I am mad for writing this but does a show that is fantastic but sucks the soul and heart out of you make for as good TV as everyone believes; or was everyone else too caught up in the hype to admit their true feelings about Breaking Bad."
NA,"mundoaudiofilo","Jun 30, 2015",10,"Couldn't wait for it to end.",NA,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
NA,"TheLittleSongbird","Nov 12, 2017",10,"Among the best and most addictive shows there is",NA,"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
NA,"FishDrowned","Nov 8, 2021",10,"By far the greatest show I've ever watched",NA,"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic."
NA,"gogoschka-1","Jan 11, 2014",10,"If you mix Scarface, Robin Hood and maybe Tyler Durden with enough meth - you'll get a mean cocktail called 'Heisenberg'",NA,"Nothing compares.

NA,"joegalgano","Aug 11, 2021",10,"in a category all on its own.",NA,"I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.Thank you for existing."
NA,"agatt-87232","May 19, 2019",10,"Since GOT is over, this is Officially the Greatest show ever made",NA,"If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest."
NA,"Leofwine_draca","May 4, 2021",10,"Every bit as good as you've heard",NA,"I usually don't comment on here but this show is the best I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark.Just look at the rating for breaking bad and you'll know what's up. Not many shows can hold up this rating for so long."
NA,"dristysultana","Jun 23, 2021",10,"Masterpiece",NA,"Ok, so while it isn't quite the holy grail it's made out to be, 'Breaking Bad' is a solid series. I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable.
Enjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show."
NA,"arjanhylkema","Nov 7, 2016",10,">10",NA,"As Planet Earth I was released about ten years ago, a visual improvement could have been expected due to the use of advanced technology, but man, did they up their game. The camera-work and the use of music were both truly superb, as well as the editing in which different sub- segments were all synced so well with the narrating of it by David Attenborough. It was nothing like a nature documentary, it was way beyond that. The short and different segments, were movies on itself. It contained all the different genres, from experiencing the thrill in a Hollywood-like impossible action-escape scenario to having a comical and truly euphoric moment of realization about the true extent of what nature has to offer. And this was all brought so incredibly well.If we had any more of such heavenly quality programs on TV, I would simply just glue my eyes to my TV and live out the rest of my life as a vegetable."
NA,"Wentloog","Nov 5, 2016",10,"At once awe-inspiring and terrifying!",NA,"I have just finished watching the first episode on BBC 1 and I am amazed to find that Planet Earth II appears to have bettered the original! The photography is perfect and Attenborough's narration, both content and delivery, is unparalleled. This initial outing is titled ""Islands"" and whilst I don't want to dwell on the individual segments, the Racer Snakes vs baby Iguanas is probably the most terrifying piece of natural history film I have ever witnessed, not for the fainthearted or squeamish!The ""making of segment at the end of the documentary proper was particularly enjoyable and informative.This is what the BBC does best and long may it last."
NA,"john-m-madsen","Nov 5, 2016",10,"Yet another masterpiece from BBC Nature & David Attenborough",NA,"What to say about Planet Earth II which has not already been said about so many other fantastic productions from BBC Nature?I've no idea.However: the production values are as always the very best in the business, the photography is likewise unmatched and it's all tied together with masterful insight and authority by David Attenborough, the man who through more than four decades has taught the planet more about the natural world than any ten others put together.Simply superb.The actual content? That you need to see for yourself."
NA,"thespookybuz","Nov 9, 2016",10,"Mesmerizing",NA,"The original Planet Earth back in 2006 was an astounding and refreshing series that tore down the limits of documentary making. It was universally lauded as exceptional, and if you haven't seen it then you're missing a genuine treat.Planet Earth II is everything its predecessor was. And more.Ultra sharp photography, iris-piercing colour and focus, and on a decent home set up, a superbly immersive experience. It is almost hypnotic the way the gorgeous landscapes and action scenes are interwoven with a sublime soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.The BBC receives criticism sometimes for the way it spends 'tax payers' money', but surely not for this. Whether you're aged 8 or 80, this is the highest quality television that will bewilder and astound.Truly wondrous, and David Attenborough is a legend."
NA,"pjdickinson","Nov 5, 2016",10,"Astounding",NA,"The professionalism of everyone involved in this glorious production is evident in every frame of what is seen and every second of what is heard. Most Hollywood blockbusters would struggle to compete with the cinematography on show here. Shot after shot seem almost impossible yet impossibly beautiful. Few things fill a viewer with simple awe but the first episode about islands does it and then some. The fact that it is all so enjoyable just adds to the experience. David Attenborough's narration is, as usual, superb.Whatever the cost it was worth it. The BBC has another hit."
NA,"dbijis33","Nov 8, 2016",10,"Dangerously beautiful",NA,"Hello this is my first written review. Note that I haven't watched the first season (2006) so I can't compare both.This series will get you the feels when you read a good book, watched a good movie, or played a good game, because this is more than good.THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE and of course with the danger of nature itself included.I don't know how they got those shots and the audio, even the music just like the rush when you first meet your crush, and the story with narration slaps you with the cold harsh of reality and the mesmerizing it gave. You are watching a book of life with enough drama and some bitter truth in every paradise, because life is never perfect.I'm very thankful for whomever people that makes this show to be realized, from the smallest task to the most dangerous.Thank you very much for this ineffable experience."
NA,"dhanrajjughead","Nov 17, 2016",10,"Greatest documentary ever created.",NA,"By far the greatest and best nature documentaries ever made. Everyone needs to watch this. I have no idea how many hours it must have taken to film this, and it seems like the people who made this are totally out of their minds. The snow leopard scenes in episode 2 are so brilliant it's amazing. It's one of the rarest animals ever shot on film and they've managed to shoot so much of it. It's crazy. They deserve every little credit they get. I'm thoroughly impressed by the work put into this and i'm sure it surpasses the work put into any Hollywood action film ever created. I think I learned a lot more from these people, more than how much I learned from the content itself."
NA,"NeilBarnett","Nov 13, 2016",10,"Best thing on TV since last Planet Earth",NA,"This is without doubt the best thing I have seen on television for years. The photography, narration and general story telling of the lives of the animals is simply breath-taking.Episode 1 was animals that live on islands. As others have mentioned I have never seen such a more terrifying piece of natural-history photography in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it or caught it on YouTube but I never thought I would be shouting at the TV for Iguana's to run. Episode 2 was mountain living wildlife from Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation to Snow Leopards. This programme is one of the few examples which envelopes you in its documentary telling. You are seeing things for the first time and you are left with wanting more. Roll on episode 3, jungles."
NA,"salmanu-27386","Nov 6, 2016",10,"Excellent",NA,"The opening image of Planet Earth II contained the promise of everything to come. It was spectacular, it was beautiful, it was magical. A hot air balloon floated like a snowflake, two miles abovean Alpine.The theme of the episode was ""Islands"", and we got off to a winningly cute start with a visit to idyllic Escudo, off Panama. Its star attraction is a three-toed pygmy sloth spurred into slow motion action by the cry of a potential mate. But no doubt what most people will remember, and talk about today, were the baby iguanas running the gauntlet of swarms of racer snakes on the Galapagos island of Fernandina.how beautiful our world and its living thing .....and how beautiful and big the creator of this whole universe ....I think people have to watch this types of films which is real one ."
NA,"panagiotiskatsanos","Dec 31, 2016",10,"One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen",NA,"One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen. Every episode is a new wonderful experience,getting to know the world that surrounds us. David Attenborough is the best narrator out there and this is his latest masterpiece. The crew has worked hard and managed to capture a large aspect of wild life whether it lives on a remote island in the arctic ocean or deep in one of the large human cities in India or United States of America. It shows that they put a lot of effort and time filming this under harsh conditions,but the close up captures of wild animals in their natural environment was worth the effort. Watched it already twice and will watch it again! This is something to watch again and again with your children, until the next Planet Earth arrives. Well done!"
NA,"ianrobo","Nov 19, 2016",10,"In times of climate deniers, hope",NA,"Plant Earth 2 was everything you would expect and more. Every scene, every vista shows that humans are the real parasites on this planet and the animals should rule us, not the other way round.However it gives me hope, it says to me people will watch this, hear about it and see the folly of our actions at some time.Hope is far better than despair.Oh David Attenborough, you are the king of us all"
NA,"adamonIMDb","Dec 28, 2016",7,"Breathtaking",NA,"I never thought the original 'Planet Earth' could be topped, but 10 years on and Attenborough has given us something that is every bit as good, if not even better, than the first series.'Planet Earth II' is everything I had hoped it would be and more. Visually breathtaking, mesmerising and at times unbelievable, with expert narration by the legendary David Attenborough. Documentaries as awe-inspiring as this don't come about very often.I always enjoy the 'making of' at the end of each episode, giving us an insight into the lengths that the crew go to capture the footage. They deserve a lot more credit than they get. 'Planet Earth' is, without question, the greatest documentary ever made and a must see."
NA,"tinyfordst","May 19, 2019",10,"More irritated with IMDb for the bias than with the show",NA,"Was Planet Earth 2 good? Absolutely, it was a visual masterpiece with locations that not even the creators of Avatar could've dreamt up, animals we didn't know existed (literally) and AMAZING music.The problem lies in the fact that the ""facts"" given were all a bit loosely based on the truth. A lot of what was said is suspicion, and even some of it has been proven wrong in the years that followed. Some of what was said has been proven false even before the show was recorded, but because the most beloved nature voice (David Attenborough) said it, nobody questioned anything.Finally what really bugs me is why IMDb decided to put it in first place with only 70 000 votes and not even with as few as that can it sustain a REAL average of 9.0. It makes no sense why it is placed ahead of shows with millions of votes that average a REAL 9.3. I believe it's time that IMDb admit, this show is not #1, because the ratings don't say it is, put Breaking Bad in the position it belongs, and which it deserves."

NA,"farshidkarimi","Nov 22, 2016",10,"What a Beautiful Planet- Bewitching !",NA,"This is my first comment and I hope I am not bungling it.I have been watching nature documentaries for many years. Everyone of them has been a depiction of beauty of nature and the planet we are living in.With all the bloodshed and cruelty that is unfolding all around, committed by US human beings, it is a relief to the heart, so soothing to the mind and calming to the eye to see such an enthralling master piece. The mesmerizing scenes of birds, soaring in the blue sky, their sleek feathers glimmering in the sun, the captivating green of leaves trembling in wake of monkeys jumping over them, the enchanting scene of Nubian Ibex baby deftly climbing down the cliff, dodging the red fox, the eye relieving sight of flamingos parading in a single line and all the grandeur of mountains superimposed by the stars in the time lapse, specks of ice swaying down in the winter scene and all enrapturing beauties of nature playing out right in front of our eyes, it is all a reminder of how majestic this world is.The trance is culminated by the legendary voice of the gem, Sir. David Attenborough. He is a major part of all this beauty. All this fragile beauty and all the majesty of these creatures invokes a feeling in the viewers mind and heart that this world, nature, animals and human beings living in it are mystically intertwined, connected and linked. I also bow in respect to the crew involved in the creation of this priceless jewel, especially the cameramen, honing it to perfection. I hope more people watch such stunning documentaries so that they will admire life on Planet Earth."
NA,"TheLittleSongbird","Oct 12, 2017",10,"Like the first 'Planet Earth', does for nature and our planet as 'Walking with Dinosaurs' did with the dinosaurs",NA,"Absolutely adore the first 'Planet Earth' from 2007, one of the best documentaries ever made and actually is more than that. David Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a national treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the term.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. 'Planet Earth II' is as good as others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecessor one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actually feels much more than that. Throughout it's an awe-inspiring, utterly transfixing experience where one forgets they're watching a documentary and instead feeling like they're watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but to me and many others 'Planet Earth II' is completely deserving of its praise and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BBC has done in years.'Planet Earth II' for starters looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and real life, the mountains in ""Mountains"" in particular are spectacular and ""Jungles"" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle beautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normally bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter moments, Hans Zimmer's music here is a remarkably good fit, it's unmistakably Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances them.What of the narrative aspects? Can't fault 'Planet Earth II' in this aspect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise. In short, it's just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance was even achieved in the ""Cities"" episode, that may have been the one that transfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habitats of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illuminate, and credit has to go to 'Planet Earth II' for adhering to what made 'Planet Earth' work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nice ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, there's a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never preaches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins in ""Islands"") and the dangerous (the lions in ""Grasslands"" and ""Deserts""), and one actually finds they're rooting for them in exactly the same way they would a human character. 'Planet Earth II' contains a good deal of suspense (especially in ""Deserts"") and emotional impact (""Islands""). Even the fights/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in ""Jungles"".It doesn't feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes feel episodic or repetitive. 'Planet Earth II' instead feels like a collection of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans of 'Planet Earth', 'Planet Earth II' is not to be missed at all costs and has more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding something new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

It is the single most astounding cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. The cinematography, narration, and score are hands down the best I have ever seen. Never has my entire family been so excited to watch the next episode of a program or movie.Planet Earth II lays out in 5 episodes life on earth in 6 separate Earth habitats: Islands, Mountains, Jungles, Deserts, Grasslands, and Cities. Each one dives into live and it's will to survive in a level you've never seen before. Truly remarkable cinematography and color will literally make you gasp for air and your eyes open wide.

NA,"adam-whitmore","Jan 5, 2017",10,"Peerless evocation of nature across the globe",NA,"This is not just one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made - superbly filmed using the latest techniques and equipment – it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its makers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger than ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and to this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effects. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far - for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnecessarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far, and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely wonderful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the largest, best quality screen you can find. The Blu-ray transfer is excellent.In reviewing last year's outstanding ""The Hunt"" I wrote that I found it hard to imagine how even the BBC wildlife unit could surpass that. Now I see. Can even the BBC wildlife surpass this? Maybe Planet Earth 3?"
NA,"robert-kamer","Feb 8, 2007",10,"11 out of 10",NA,"I don't think I can add anything to the previous 10 out of 10 comments, other than that I'd give it a full 11 out of 10 if this were possible. I have seen my share of nature documentaries, but this takes the cake. Utterly awe-inspiring, mesmerizing and brilliant. I own an extensive DVD-collection, but if I had to choose 1 title and had to throw away everything else I had, this would be the one I'd keep. I have no better DVD-title in my collection. Period.David Attenborough is my personal hero. Although he merely provides the commentary for this series (as he did with the also terrific Blue Planet), but his work for the BBC's Natural History division (setting it up and making several brilliant series himself) and his inspiring personality make him one of the true greats.Miss this at your peril."
NA,"jim-1409","Nov 19, 2008",10,"A masterpiece of a documentary",NA,"The camera work is truly breathtaking. Such amazing wonders captured on film, areas of the planet unspoiled by human domination. DIfferences in culture seem to play a big part in the reviews of this documentary; some choosing to review based on ""Disney"" like criteria. Criticisms for the apparent emphasis on the viscous and dark side of animals and nature. I guess some people would prefer a nice talking lion and perhaps an Elton john song thrown in.Cutting slack on the sarcasm and returning to the point; This is a must watch documentary for anybody with a sincere appreciation for life and the planet in which we live.An achievement for all those involved in the making to be proud of."
NA,"ccthemovieman-1","Jan 4, 2009",10,"In A Word: Amazing",NA,"Thankfully, I caught a couple of these episodes on American television, which led me to this 11-part series on Blu-Ray DVDs and over five hours of outstanding entertaining and education. Looking back, I still shake my head in amazement at the things I saw on these discs.Obviously, the incredible photography and sharpness/color (please see this on high-def, if you can) is the first thing that captures the viewer's eye, but as the series went on I appreciated the objectivity in here (""aw, cute"" shots mixed in with the brutality of existence) and the lack of environmental propaganda, which one usually gets in boatloads in these ""nature"" films. Here, the writers and narrator David Attenborough just present the world as it is. Only at the very end do you get a short environmental message. It isn't needed: the beauty of this earth says it all, and the writers were smart enough to figure that out during this series.After viewing 11 discs, you come to the obvious conclusions that in the Earth's world of animals, birds and fish come only a few objectives: where to find food, water, a mate, and escape being devoured by a predator. That's it, except for pets or zoo animals. On land or in water, it's simply a matter of survival, as this BBC series shows us.What makes this so special is that, thanks to incredible work by cameramen, we are privy to many extraordinary sights we would never see, if left on our own, and never imagined existed on this planet. Much of this series is simply mind-boggling to view, especially all the overhead shots, which were stunning.There are too many positive adjectives I could use to even begin, in recommending you watch this. Just give it a try - any of the 11 segments - and see if you don't want to then watch all of them."
NA,"cmcoveos","Dec 15, 2006",10,"The most amazing achievement in natural history TV has ever given",NA,"The subtitle of the series is not an exaggeration; it has a literal meaning: This is indeed our planet as ""never seen before"". Right from the outset you are witnessing the most amazing pictures modern technology has ever produced: Views from space, but close enough so we may see the glorious beauty of specific regions of our home planet. Birds of paradise of such beauty that can convince you this is the real paradise and you need not ask for anything more; All the creatures are filmed in unique settings and situations (a polar bear with two cubs emerging from their den as spring comes and gliding down a snow covered slope, the strategic genius of wild dogs encircling a herd of impalas, rare views of a snow leopard and her cub, a white shark in chase of a seal bursting completely out of the sea and hanging in the air for a second and hundreds of other breath-taking shots. Feeling happy for the gift you are given and the next moment plunged in bitter thoughts about how unbelievably brutally has mankind treated it. My rating: Definitely 10/10."
NA,"Loordssm","Sep 1, 2007",10,"Simply put, stunning",NA,"I have never, ever given any title a perfect ten. Mainly because I never thought that there will ever be something that truly deserves the praise. I was so wrong. Watching this amazing display of planet earth's resources in high definition is just simply breath taking. In addition David Attenboroughs commentary is spot on. Calm, informative and quiet in just the right places. Sometimes the picture is so beautiful, that one just simply forgets the commentary and just starer in awe on the beauty of the landscapes and other details. Sometimes the director feeds the viewer with juicy bits of slow motion scenes to add to the effect of the moment. I simply can't recommend this title enough to everyone. Just pick it up anywhere you can find it. Spectacular."

The sheer work that went into its making alone is impressive. The shots that are captured on film are like none ever seen and remind us of both the power of mother nature and her fragility. I highly recommend this series to people of all ages as there is something for everyone. If you do watch any of the episodes, do watch ""Pole to Pole"". It is a great all-encompassing view of many animals and their habitats. David Attenborough does a great job as narrator. If you enjoy this series also check out ""The Blue Planet"", a series by the BBC on oceans (also narrated by Attenborough)."
NA,"bob the moo","Apr 30, 2006",10,"A visually impressive and memorable look at the world that we live in",NA,"As the influence of man expands across the globe, fewer and fewer truly untouched wilderness exists. This series aims to use technology never used for nature programmes before to take us into these wildernesses and see the environment within them and the creatures that live there. Starting with a journey from one pole to the other, this series explores the extreme conditions of mountains (from the birth of one to the coldest of those existing), deserts, caves, oceans, fresh waters and others to present some of the most impressive footage ever seen in a nature documentary.With a budget of about £40 million, the BBC were going to have to deliver something pretty special to avoid the usual accusations of waste tax payer's money, catering to a small audience etc etc. However with Planet Earth they have easily silenced the critics to present a nature programme that is interesting and education. The biggest selling point is the footage which, at its worst is impressive but at its best is simply breath-taking and actually had me saying ""wow"" at some points. I am not naturally a nature programme viewer but this show had me hooked from episode 1 where a quick glance at the opening minutes had me staying with it for the following eleven weeks. The footage is impressive and, although it is the weakest part of each hour, I did enjoy some of the ""Planet Earth Diary"" sections where we actually saw the technology, techniques and sheer trial of getting the views that we get. My words can't really do it justice but the series gives footage that you won't have seen anywhere else before  with episode 1 claiming that the footage of a pack of dogs hunting told experts things they hadn't previously known.However I have seen some a couple of nature documentary feature films recently that have also had impressive footage but Planet Earth backs it up with a typically informative and engaging narration from David Attenborough. For me he added enough educational value to prevent the series just being televisual wallpaper  which of course is what it also does in terms of providing some beautiful material that would work even if the sound broke on your television. Like many others though, I would have liked there to be more connection made to the impact that man's actions are having on the ecosystems and animals that we are shown  for example are they getting rarer or having their habitats shrinking? Occasionally it does this but nowhere near enough  which is partly why some critics have labelled it ""environmental porn"", which I can understand but do not totally agree with.Overall this is a great series that does a great job of presenting the beauty of the natural world but just about having enough educational value to it to avoid it just being the television equivalent of wallpaper for your computer. The shots are impressive and the range of creatures and habitats that are presented makes this well worth seeing. I'm sure that wildlife fans will long for more detail but as a casual viewer this was just what I was looking for. An impressive and memorable look at the world that we live in."

I just hope that in 100 years time people will not watch 'Planet Earth' with the same curiosity that I have when look at etchings of the Dodo from old books.TV like 'Planet Earth' has made me think a lot more about the natural world that surrounds me and the impact I am having on it.

Kind of simple, don't you think? It's not an Al Gore ""made up"" movie. It just show images of our planet and what happens in the animal world. It's not a ""made up"" Micheal Moore film. It's just shows beautiful images of our planet. I mean my goodness, just watch it for what it is instead of making a big deal out of everything.

NA,"planktonrules","Jun 1, 2015",7,"It doesn't get any better than this.",NA,"This is going to be an unpopular review. But if even just one of you find it helpful, then there is hope for the Universe.Visually this is a stunning achievement. Read the other reviews about that stuff. But philosophically, it left me cold, empty and somewhat disgusted. This series focuses very heavily (almost exclusively) on two things: eating and procreating. It portrays animal life at its worst: savage, selfish and opportunistic. Having been intimately involved in wildlife studies & conservation, I can tell you that there's more to animal life than this.Imagine a race of aliens doing a documentary about human life, and they focus exclusively on slaughterhouses and daycare centers. That would hardly be a fair portrayal of the wonders of which we humans are capable. As a human, I'm sure you'd be outraged that the higher pursuits, like art and study, had been overlooked in favour of the more sensational, dramatic and carnal elements of life.The segments about predators (wild dogs, cougars, sharks, hawks) show them to be nothing more than killing machines (complete with the obligatory soundtrack - minor key, low cello note). They are invariably shown either hunting or eating. Or thinking about hunting. There is no footage of the fascinating wild dog ""singing"" rituals, playtime or simple leisure--the stuff they do when they're not ripping antelope to shreds, you know? Unfortunately documentaries like this only serve to reinforce the myopic opinion that ""nature is savage"". And in turn, humans feel it is their duty to emulate such savagery. If this documentary were indeed what it purports to be--an objective view of the planet Earth--then it would have offered not only the vulgar cycles of life and death but the inscrutable mysteries of life that do not fall into that category. Aside from a 5-second shot of a polar bear tobogganing down a hillside (which Attenborough narrates as ""she may be cleaning her fur or simply enjoying herself""), this documentary claims to understand everything about animals, limited to killing and procreation, of course.Serious nature enthusiasts may be offended. Werner Herzog would be proud (""I believe the common denominator of the Universe is not harmony, but chaos, hostility and murder""--Grizzly Man). Me, I was severely bummed out. I rate this a 10 for cinematography and a 5 for content. Watch it as a feast for the eyes. But make no mistake, there is a lot more to life on Earth than what this show implies. And Sir David Attenborough has a very anthropocentric view of the world. It is no wonder that, when asked why he does not endorse vegetarianism, he said, alluding to the superiority of the human species, that he has no moral problem with killing animals and also added that he ""doesn't love animals, but is fascinated by them."" He openly admitted hating rats and said that his favourite animal is the human being (source: funtrivia.com). Implied: ""Animals suck."""
NA,"dakuchonekobing","Oct 8, 2020",3,"Only 4 Eps can touch my soul!",NA,"Planet Earth is a worthy documentary series that looks not just at the animals and plants in remote areas, but at the ever-changing ecosystems that look prone to collapse in the near future. This is the sort of programme that the BBC excels at and makes better than anyone else.The camera-work is fantastic and the sections at the end of each programme where they look at how certain parts were filmed is interesting as you see the dedication of the crew who go out to these desolate spots for months to film sections that will last only a couple of minutes on screen. Much of the wildlife has barely been filmed and some such as the wonderfully agile Wild Amur leopard have probably only been seen by very few living people in the flesh.It is narrated by David Attenborough who has the perfect voice for wildlife documentaries and his presence is almost a guarantee of quality in itself. His record speaks for itself.Some of the sequences shown are very brave, most notably the struggles of the polar bear to find food on the ever-decreasing Arctic ice. Too many nature documentaries succumb to ""niceness"" and show only cute animals looking sweet. To understand how Man is changing the planet it is crucial to show how wasting energy may be affecting wildlife in distant lands (or seas). Sadly it is also important as it seems all too likely that much of the footage will become museum property in the near future, showing subsequent generations the marvellous diversity of life Earth used to enjoy.Overall it has some good educational value as it can be enjoyed both by young children and was recommended by my tutors during a conservation module of my degree."
NA,"rooprect","Dec 4, 2007",10,"Should be called ""BBC - Yeah, animals suck""",NA,"OK, I'm writing this to explain few things to people who wrote their reviews and gave this documentary 1 or 3 point with argument that there were too much killing and gallons of blood were shed or something like that.I've read where these guys are from, one from NYC and one from Toronto etc... it's pretty easy to forget what real life is about when you have full fridge in the kitchen, Wallmart next to your house and McDonald on your way to work, isn't it? It's pretty easy to forget when all you have to do to feed yourself is PUT THAT BURGER in your mouth. You guys forgetting what is wild reality about? To survive! In fact, animals spend most of the time (I think I've heard somewhere it's actually 16 hours of day!) searching for food or potential prey. So WAKE UP! What the hell did you wanted to see in the documentary?! How lion changing channels on his TV and playing computer games? Oh no, that's what YOU do all day instead of killing your future dinner! If you were thrown to savanna, or forest or anywhere else, you would probably die actually, but if not, you would spend your whole day looking for food. Believe me.Yes, this documentary is sometimes brutal, it's no cute Lion King story. Nothing for kids. But it shows reality.

From rare animals rarely spotted in the wild to incredible time lapses to beautiful panoramic shots from space, the film provides some of the most humbling images I have ever seen.

It is the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC, and it was the first ever in high definition. So really, it set the bar for high picture quality.

Narrated by David Attenborough (of course).An excellent documentary series on the wildlife of Earth: their habitats, seasonal patterns, how they survive and thrive (or sometimes don't). By breaking down the series into episodes that each cover a different habitat you can see how the different species compete and are often dependent on each other.

NA,"wildcatt268","Jan 18, 2002",10,"One of the best war movies/series ever",NA,"I have read virtually all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of his best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to them all. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt.Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilites, had to learn to turn over his initial company-level responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander.  It was clearly tough for him, particularly when he had to order attacks on heavily defended objectives, without being to lead his former command directly.   All of the characters were developed enough that you cared about each of them as individuals, and felt the loss of each of them through the attrition during the brutal fighting in the Northern European Theater. They cared for each other as fighting men do (confirmed by my own experience in the infantry in Vietnam), but at the same time they had to carry on with the mission regardless of loss.  Replacements are regarded warily at first, but then managed to blend in with the veterans if they showed they were worthy of joining this band of brothers.  The plot is real, and as such is neither macho nor macabre--it just is presented as it really happened.  The truths of combat are stranger than fiction.  The interviews with the actual veterans, interspersed throughout the series, added authenticity, verified what the series was showing. These representatives of ""The Greatest Generation"" did themselves and this nation proud. Though I knew the story well, I eagerly looked for to each new episode to see how well it tracked with the book and how well the actors and director portrayed it.  Up to this series, I had thought that ""Once an Eagle"" (starring Sam Elliot) was the best war series, but this one is now at the top of the class in my view."

NA,"rbverhoef","Feb 13, 2003",10,"Excellent",NA,"This week I saw three things based on WW-II novels. The first was 'The Pianist' about the Warsaw ghetto in the war and the survival of a Jewish pianist in that ghetto. The second was 'De Tweeling', a Dutch film about two twin-sisters, separated in 1926. One of them grows up in Nazi-Germany, the other in The Netherlands. That movie shows us more of the common persons during the war, Germans and not-Germans. The third was 'Band of Brothers', a true story about combat in the war. All three things are great, the films I mean, and you definitely should see all three of them.'Band of Brothers' follows Easy-company from their training in England, through D-Day, the rest of France (including Bastogne), Holland (including operation Market Garden), Germany and Austria. This story is shown to us in ten different episodes. Every episode starts with the real men from Easy-company telling about their experiences and ends with a short written update of Easy-company. Between beginning and ending of episodes one of the best things I have seen on screen is presented to us.The casting is amazing. Even David Schwimmer (from 'Friends') as the bitter Captain Sobel is great. Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston are superb as Major Winters and Captain Lewis Nixon. Every actor seems to be perfect for his character. The photography and direction is great also. I especially loved the direction of the episode done by executive producer Tom Hanks, possibly with some help from the other executive producer Steven Spielberg. 'Saving Private Ryan' was great for showing us the horror in combat, 'Band of Brothers' does the same thing but adds some other things. You really learn to know the characters (in 600 minutes you can do that), you sympathize with them.If you have the chance to see this masterpiece, do so. It is long but you can spread the episodes over some days. But if you start watching it is very hard to stop. Definitely one of the best WW-II movies or series out there."
NA,"yodaschoda","Jan 23, 2005",10,"One of, if not the best, mini series' ever made",NA,"Band of Brothers finds us following the exploits of Easy Company throughout their campaign in Europe, from their inception all the way to the end of the war. The commentary from the actual soldiers that were in those situations is touching, to say the very least. These commentaries also help to move the character development along quite a bit, as it lets us into their own personal thoughts on the situations they faced. This project, to the best of my knowledge was undertaken at roughly the same time as Saving Private Ryan, using many of the same locations and also employing DreamWorks special effects, giving it a very familiar feel for anyone that has seen Private Ryan. As I've already touched on, the character development is greatly due to the fact that this story is not told in a two hour segment, but throughout several hour long intervals, giving us the chance to truly ""get to know"" the characters personalities as the story develops. In my humble opinion, the only other military type mini series' that even come close to the scope of this one are The Blue and The Grey, and North and South.All of the actors in this series do and excellent job at playing the roles appropriately and making us believe the hell these men were put through. The thing I also appreciated about the cast is the lack of any ""real"" names, leading to us not knowing who may or may not be making it out the scenes alive and unscathed.This mini series is everything Saving Private Ryan was, as well as everything it wasn't. If you're a fan of war time stories and ""army"" movies, this is hands down the best of the best I don't even think I could name ANY movies about WWII that could even compare to this one A bold statement, I know, but I'm making it any how."

There has been put so much effort in taking care of all the details that it makes you believe that you are right in the middle of all the action. This is an outstanding achievement. It's about ten hours long, but I wouldn't mind if it was a few hours longer. Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company, talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with. When you buy the special edition DVD box (a metal case with 6 instead of 5 DVD's), you will find the complete interviews with these men on the extra DVD. These interviews certainly aren't to be missed! As you may have guessed, I'm one of the biggest fans of this series.

NA,"bsmith5552","Nov 5, 2001",10,"Realistic WWII Drama With Warts Included",NA,"""Band of Brothers"" in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself. Told over ten gut wrenching episodes, the story centers on a company of soldiers in the 101st American Airborne Division in WWII from their initial basic training to their landing in France on D-Day to their many battles and ordeals through to the liberation of a concentration camp and finally through to the end of the war. The soldiers are ordinary people thrust into horrific situations and shows how each is able (or not able) to deal with the situations. The battle scenes are realistic and convincing and the special effects are breath taking. While the series depicts the trials and tribulations of the company, it isn't afraid to show how the war affects seemingly sane and rational men. For example there is a scene where the nominal hero of the story, Winters (Damien Lewis) shoots an unarmed German soldier out of frustration. There is also a scene where a group of German prisoners are cut down by an American officer after he had given them cigarettes. Even after the German surrender there are instances of out and out murder of Germans. This is very rare for an American war story. The cast is of largely unknown actors, which makes for a more effective telling of the story. There is no John Wayne leading the troops to victory kind of thing. Damien Lewis is very good as Winters who rises through the ranks to lead the company. Ron Livingston plays his friend and second in command, Nixon. Others include David Schwimmer, excellent as the training officer, Scott Grimes as Malarkey the grizzled sergeant and ex New Boys on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg effective as Corporal Lipton. ""Band of Brothers"" is a story that could only be told in a mini-series. It clearly shows that war really is hell."
NA,"faded_english_monkey","Aug 25, 2004",10,"war, no frills",NA,"I absolutely love this miniseries.As a keen amateur historian, I got sick and tired of books and documentaries about the great leaders, politics, geography and basically, the non-bloodshed parts of WW2.Similarly virtually every time I saw a war movie, it was ruined by flashbacks( thin red line) ridiculous fiction (and yes, i do mean you, The Bunker) or completely unnecessary and out of place sex scenes (who can forget Enemy At The Gates, a powerful film, until that awful sex scene which ruined the whole thing?)There are good war movies. But this stands out, because not only is there no fiction whatsoever, but because, as a miniseries, more time is available to get to know the characters, and follow their progress, to know them, to love them, to mourn them.Time allows for detail, and the fact that the 'frills' that other films stick in to make them more viewer friendly and marketable have been left out....When a character in BoB dies, you mourn not because a flashback tells you they have a young sweetheart or something...but because you know this is real, it happened. The acting is truly superb, and you realise, it isn't a character you are mourning at all, it's a real person. This is because the actors made very strong relationships with their real life surviving counterparts, they knew their roles inside out and it really does show. We feel so strongly for the characters because the actors have portrayed them so faithfully. There are no clichés, because the truth is so accurately reproduced.After reading Ambrose's book, you realise how religiously each part of the series is portrayed. The sets are perfect, the effects remarkable, and Michael Kamens score will go down as one of the finest ever written. Everything about the production of this series is phenomenal, the details are so minute yet so important.This should be watched not just for entertainment value, but as a reminder of the sacrifices made for us. Easily the best television series ever produced.Watch it. Now."
NA,"planktonrules","May 30, 2015",7,"You can't beat this....",NA,"""Band of Brothers"" is a nearly 12 hour long show about the experiences of a group of soldiers during their tour of duty in Europe during WWII. Given that it is this long, it allows so much more in the way of character development and story telling than a typical war movie. The closest thing to this quality-wise is the original version of ""Das Boot""--as it was a mini-series and was later spliced apart to make it a motion picture. But even then, the German submarine film was only about 40% as long and never got into the detail and had quite the emotional impact as ""Band of Brothers"". In every way, the show screams quality--with amazing sets, details and direction. In fact, while the budget for this was large ($125,000,000 according to IMDb), it was actually pretty small considering the number of actors, the amazing sets and the length of the series. This is a must-see for anyone and I would say more and heap more praise on the film except that there are already hundreds and hundreds of other reviews on IMDb that pretty much do that already."

NA,"faded_Glory","May 2, 2006",10,"Not very realistic at all",NA,"Lots of people applaud this series for its realism, but I can't really agree. I think there is still too way much Hollywood here and a lot of the scenes are cliché. The Germans are almost without exception behaving as total amateurs. For example, in the Crossroads episode they let themselves be completely surprised by the American attack in the rear, and in response they go running round in the open like a bunch of headless chickens to be shot down in droves. Yet we are told that these are SS soldiers. The SS was a crack unit and I don't believe that they were such poor soldiers to let this happen to them. One of the first things you get taught in tactical school is to secure your perimeter and set guards in all directions.The American side too made huge blunders, if we accept this to be a realistic depiction of what happened in reality. Take the attack on the village of Foy (another place where we constantly see crowds of Germans nervously running around in the open for no apparent reason). The Americans knew that the Germans had artillery and tanks there, yet they assault the village with less than one Company of infantry without any attempt to soften up the defenders first! What are they thinking? Where was the Air Force? Couldn't they bomb the village first? Where was the American artillery? Couldn't they lay a barrage on the village before the attack? Why not use smoke grenades to give themselves some cover when they crossed the open fields? And we are supposed to feel sorry for the guys that their attack got bogged down? Also very unrealistic is the layout of the opposing sides in the Last Patrol episode. If you believe this, the lines were less than hundred meters apart, yet on both sides people were walking around right in the open, and exposing themselves at the windows etc. At night they show some huge spotlights on the German side - surely those would be immediate targets given that they only appear to be a couple of hundred meters away from the Americans and plainly visible? Ridiculous! The behaviour of the Americans during the shelling in the Bastogne wood is equally unrealistic. Why are they all walking around in the open and talking to each other if they were so close to the German lines and expecting to come under fire? They should have been sitting in their foxholes, observing the enemy, not walking around chatting as if they were taking a stroll in the park! And then when the first shells explode why are some of them running round like idiots, shouting to the others to take cover? Don't you think that these D-day veterans would know by now to take cover when the shells start flying? All this kind of stuff that is only designed to get us excited and rooting for the characters is typical Hollywood nonsense. Never mind the decent acting, the good costumes and props, the camera-work - if the overall behaviour of the characters is quite unbelievable the entire story falls flat on its face. I am still waiting for the first truly realistic depiction of front-line combat - but I don't think I will ever get to see it, because in reality it isn't very photogenic so it wouldn't sell."

It starts with the basic training in Toccoa,Ga, and continues through Normandy, The battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market Garden, among others, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp.

This is because it taps into the darkest days of the 20th century from which the greatest sacrifices were made, and the greatest heroes were forged. They simply wouldn't make BoB this way anymore and it wouldn't be as significant. Because 20 years age, most of us still had parents and grandparents who were still alive who had fought in or experienced WW2. So it was very much still real and close to all of us. 20 years later it is now almost entirely part of history books as opposed to being something we can still feel. Band of Brothers immortalised a number of ordinary but inspirational men and their stories, which were a microcosm for the stories of the millions of people and families around the globe and their experiences in humanity's darkest days. It would also be too political and careful if it were made these days. Because enough distance has passed people now for people to feel comfortable enough to criticise what happened as seen from a modern perspective and may even try to denigrate or change the narrative to serve their delusions or agenda. Because they no longer have to look into the eyes of the ordinary men and women who had to do terrible things and make terrible sacrifices being thrust into scenarios they did not create. So a series like Band of Brothers will never and could never be made again, so treasure it."

I almost hate to add yet another glowing endorsement since the other reviews are pretty much identical...but here goes. This one made me wonder WHERE DOES AMERICA GET SUCH MEN? The things that Easy Company (boy, there's irony for you!) went through. I've always been grateful to all those who fought for my freedom (I served my country but never had to fight) and have wondered how men could do the awful things that had to be done. I've admired those who actually faced combat. Anyway, Band of Brothers is superbly done historically correct documentary about E Co, 101st Airborne. It follows the lives (and sometimes deaths) of the men of Easy Co. The miniseries takes the men through most of their combat engagements. The cinematography is outstanding. Spielberg and Hanks really did a great job on this miniseries! There are some interviews with some of the survivors, who have remained close to this day. Disks 1-5 are the actual miniseries but WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SKIP DISK 6! There is a lot of information about how the film was cast, the ""boot camp"" that the actors went through and how soft actors were turned into lean, hard fighting men.

I watched the wire about 3 years ago well after the series concluded, and watched it in the same binge watching way I watched The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Game of thrones. I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series. Even small side characters have intriguing stories that progress throughout the entire series, and I have never seen more attention to detail. This show isn't built up with such high expectations for people who haven't seen it for no reason, watch it , and there is about a 99.99% chance you will become one of those previously mentioned 3000 people recommending it to everyone you know who hasn't seen it."

On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism...

NA,"jaoneal","Sep 19, 2006",10,"Fantastic",NA,"I don't subscribe to HBO. A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described as a ""gritty crime drama"" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen.I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here.The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.There is no way to avoid having ""the best show ever"" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks ""what the hell can be done for all of these people"" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.It's truly brilliant.

I used to think the show was boring, did not understand half of it, to be fair I am not from USA and some of the language in this show is a little too high level for a non native to understand from both the cops and drug dealers, even now I still don't get a few expressions they do or police terms. I guess I even hated it I only watched the first season and save a few scenes I was mostly boredNow I feel like my taste has matured a lot since I last saw it, decided to give it another chance, and now I see every scene, every dialogue, every line between the lines and I haven't even finished the first season again and I am loving it, maybe not yet as much as I love Sopranos or Breaking bad which are arguably simpler but very smart, real and entertaining. The Wire does feel more complex on its themes I guess it's too real in a way which is why I thought it was boring the first time, they bother with details normally other TV shows would skip or overlook.I still think Sopranos is better, it is easier to digest, but without losing that feeling of realism and being relatable on every level, but it doesn't make the wire any less important.I look forward to finishing it this time and maybe even update my review once I am all done."

It's not easy to watch--and its certainly challenging. But it is surely worth it.The story unfolds in Baltimore and is a study on the effect of institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts.Some may find the show didactic. This is understandable because its creators make heavy usage of allegory (for instance, seasons three's not-so-subtle criticism of the situation in Iraq).Didactic or not, the show forces its viewers to think about and hopefully start a larger discussion of the issues it touches upon: the failure of the drug war, the gradual extinction of the American worker and the dangers of a presumptive, preemptive war.Hats off to creators David Simon and Ed Burns (a retired BPD detective) for creating one of the most interesting, daring shows in the history of television.Let's hope HBO renews it for another 26 episodes."
NA,"Zubacz","Aug 25, 2013",5,"...while you're waiting for moments that never come.",NA,"I find it surprising to see everyone likes this show so much. Sure, the cast, direction, camera and writing are outstanding; definitely some of the best on TV, but I found the story to be lacking the entertainment value. I found the praised realism of the show to be too... real, to really be enjoyable. For a person who was in the army or police or had dealings with other uniformed organizations, the show just reaffirms what they already know. State organizations are indeed mostly governed by people doing each other favors, protecting their asses and doing as little of what is required as possible, while appearing to be doing their job. To a person who has little contact with uniformed organizations, the workings of the police department portrayed in The Wire seem realistic but unbelievable. While the acquainted person probably yearns to see another way to do things, the unacquainted hopes for the despicable vision to be finally dispelled. Not only does this not happen, but the last season shows that even people with the best intentions get corrupted and broken and the only way to manage to do something right is to lie and cheat while at it.I resented the show for giving me no closure, no satisfaction of seeing at least some improvement to the world resulting from pained efforts of the positive characters.""A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It's the sh*t that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come."" - Lester Freamon. That quote summarizes the show for me. Those moments I was waiting for never came. Moments where I would think things could be different than I expect, moments where I would learn something new.I can recommend The Wire to people who want to get insight into how governmental organizations work. When having a beer with friends, if people ask me how it is in the Police or the Army, instead of explaining, I can tell them: ""see The Wire, it shows that perfectly""."

I don't want Michael Bay, but I also want more than one life to live.No doubt the acting is amazing. The problem is that some of the characters are so uninteresting. And the stories each episode that are not driving along the plot were so boring. I forced myself to watch Season 1. I couldn't even get into it. When it finally became relatively interesting, I was able to watch a couple episodes before getting bored again. I tried Season 2, but that first episode is mindnumbingly not interesting. Nothing drags you in. I said forget this, I won't be one of the lovers of the wire. I even tried reading episode and season synopses, but even they bored me.I get why many people are drawn to this show. It takes you deeper into characters' psyches than most. Bla bla bla. But at the end of the day, I don't care. I want to be entertained. I want to escape. This bored me to no end."
NA,"shandronobrien","Sep 28, 2016",10,"An American Masterpiece: The Single Greatest Narrative of Our Generation",NA,"I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.""All the pieces matter,"" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show ""boring"" or ""slowly paced"" or ""overrated"" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two. I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them. I chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. By this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 10-fold."

Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, ""The Wire"" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting.

That was some of the most lame criticism I have ever come across on this site. I doubt the guy even watched the entire first season. This show is the best thing going on TV. Writing. Direction. Acting. Its all perfection. The people behind the show are former journalists and police officers who were covering crime in Baltimore or working the beat as cops for over 20 years. They know what they speak of and don't rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under? Please! It reached its peak in its final six episodes of the first season and haven't lived up to that magic since. It doesn't get any better than The Wire. Universal critical acclaim. The winner of the 2002 TV Critics awards. The winner of the 2004 Peabody award. Nuff said."

David Simon, a former journalist, brings a level of authenticity and depth that is rare in television. The dialogue is sharp and often laden with social and political commentary, yet it never feels preachy. The storylines are complex and interwoven, requiring viewers to pay close attention as the show gradually reveals the connections between characters and events. This narrative structure is one of the reasons ""The Wire"" is often considered challenging but rewarding to watch. It demands patience and reflection, rewarding viewers with a rich, multilayered experience that lingers long after the final credits roll."

The drama is scintillating, without being sensational. These are real people, in real life, with real struggles, played beautifully by an incredibly talented Dominic West and crew.True politics, true characters, real struggles, genuine, small triumphs,and a lot of poetic moments that are incidental and not self aware. Gotta love that.Impeccable. Everything I always wished from a crime drama. Check it out."
